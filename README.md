# Revenue Health Dashboard
## ↪️Project background:
This project was inspired from my previous role as an Associate consultant. During that time me and my manager used to work together to present a **monthly** report to Leadership containing details about upcoming revenue. 
It used to take us weeks to prepare the excel files, cross checking with other department heads about missing data, formatting, cross checking etc. The whole process was entirely manual. Ofcourse at that time, I was not aware about Powerbi. When
I started learning this tool, I made up my mind that this would be my first project!

*<h4>Disclaimer: The dataset used in this project generated synthetically to mimic an IT solutions company. Which have several on going projects, Upcoming projects in the pipeline. Revenue recognition accross different months according to variying SOW's. Please give credit if you're going to reuse the dataset. Thanks in advance! I Appreciate you stopping by here!!</h4>*
