# Revenue Health Dashboard
## ↪️Project background:
This project was inspired from my previous role as an Associate consultant. During that time me and my manager used to work together to present a **monthly** report to Leadership containing details about upcoming revenue. 
It used to take us weeks to prepare the excel files, cross checking with other department heads about missing data, formatting, cross checking etc. The whole process was entirely manual. Ofcourse at that time, I was not aware about Powerbi. When
I started learning this tool, I made up my mind that this would be my first project!
